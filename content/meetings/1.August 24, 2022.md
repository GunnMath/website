First meeting! There will be food.

This week, we will have the officers introduce themselves, go over club logistics for the year, give a quick runthrough of planned competitions, and have some general down time for math circlers to socialize. We'll also be releasing a form for people to fill out so we can try to structure our meetings as best as possible!

**IMPORTANT:** LinkTree with all relevant links is permanently located at https://linktr.ee/gunnmath.

Few announcements (**please read especially if you are a new student!**):
- Join the Discord. Roger compels you to do so :)  https://discord.gg/4HZtKwP
- Join the Discord. Most of the competition updates throughout the year (e.g. AMC signups) and forms to reserve food will be posted there. https://discord.gg/4HZtKwP
- Join the Discord. Virtually everyone who attends math circle exists on that server, so there is a lot of meaningful discussion and problems of the week! https://discord.gg/4HZtKwP

The officer team has been hard at work this summer to bring you the best UI/UX possible ! So join us on Wednesday for a great start to the math seasons!
