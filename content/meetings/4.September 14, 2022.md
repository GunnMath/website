4th meeting!

This week, we will be having a TEAM estimathon competition! In the past this has been a very interactive activity and everyone has enjoyed it greatly. There will be ego prizes for the winners as well.

Announcements:
 - The TST will be on the afternoon of October 8. If this time does not work for you, please let an officer know through discord.
 - Our first (for real) practice will be at 4:20 pm on September 15 (Thursday) in the **Acorn Lounge**. Please fill out the practice absence form at https://bit.ly/GMTAbsent if you know you can't come!
 - Come support us at the club fair on Friday (yes, we know we're a Wednesday club but SEC kind of messed up). See you all there!
