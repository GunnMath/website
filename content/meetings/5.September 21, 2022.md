5th meeting (but first after the club fair) !

This week we will be having a Kahoot trivia on Gunn Math Circle to welcome our new members. We'll also quickly catch the new members up to date on the competition information we've been telling everyone too.

- The TST is required for all GMT members, but for those of you planning on competing in math competitions at some point in the year it is also highly recommended/beneficial that you take it.
